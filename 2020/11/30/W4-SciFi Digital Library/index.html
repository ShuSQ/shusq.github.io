        <blockquote>
<p> Spaces are the result of human making. After 100 years, what does this world look like? What does the body do within it? Outside of it? What are the interfaces you use to access it? This is a short story depicting the digital library of the future.</p>
</blockquote>
<br/>

<p>I’m Kahn, a librarian.</p>
  <br/>

<p>“Hello, Kahn.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Laura.”</p>
  <br/>

<p>“Tomorrow is Blue Tellus Day, our library will receive a group of students, come here to learn the origin of mankind and Tellus history, so you need check schedule and authorize me to access some materials. “</p>
  <br/>

<p>“No problem, I will contact you later.”</p>
  <br/>

<p>Laura is an AI assistant in the library, usually helping people with reception and consultation. Everyone can easily get the information you want to seek, just chatting with her. Area 51 Library is free and open to citizens. You can also take the transportation spacecraft to our digital space station, appreciate some precious artefacts, use the immersive environmental media room to give lectures, or just spend time to enjoy your weekend. There are a million visits per day, it is easy to handle for Laura.</p>
  <br/>

<p>Okay, let me take a look at the arrangement plan.</p>
<p>* Understand the history of the Tellus - G3 geology and geophysics area</p>
<p>* Near-earth observation experience - Top Floor Observation area</p>
<p>* Rebuild Tellus lecture by Dr Fuller - Immersive Media conference room</p>
  <br/>

<p>“Hello, Laura, this a good activity. I saw that there is a lecture by Dr Fuller, who may need to use the immersive media conference room. Did you confirm whether you have received the model of the environment? Students need to show their bio ID so that they can check their route in the library at any time, if they return home, can review that day’s knowledge.”</p>
  <br/>

<p>“Okay, Kahn, Dr Fuller has already submitted the materials. We may also need to make an appointment, to prepare a few head-mounted auxiliary devices to help those students with disabilities. Maybe we can sort out a document and let them study advance at home and try to interact with the visual model.”</p>
 <br/>

 <br/>

<p>“This is what we should do. How many students will come this time? I really hope that they can have a wonderful experience, not only touching paper books but also learning more knowledge in our digital library. Communicate with sages by virtual images, we need them to rebuild Tellus… at least the students are more reliable than those politicians…”</p>
 <br/>

<p>A Sudden Noti-message: The prime minister of the coalition government, Blond Maga, has released a new reform plan, the budget of public cultural institutions would be cut, and more funds will be used to support the innovative companies.</p>
 <br/>

<p>“It’s terrible, one day I will be added to the unemployment list by them. Thanks to them, we could wander in the space.”</p>
 <br/>

<p>After the nuclear war, the earth covered in radioactive dust, is quiet and cold, by looking out the window.</p>
<br/>

 <br/>

<p>“Okay, Laura, the group access permission is approved, and now I may need a quiet environment to let me forget the bad news. Switch environment: starry sky; playing music: Georgia on My Mind, last time I saw that book, where is it? Mao Zedong went to work in Peking University Library…”</p>
<p>Over!~</p>
<hr>
<p>About the library, what impresses me is that I am reminded of the architectural prototype theory mentioned by Louis Kahn, he described the library as “a person holding a book, walk to the light. This is how the library began.” (I’m not sure what is original English text). After reading the case of the Exeter Library, I also accepted this point of view. People learn, seek knowledge, and move towards the light.</p>
<p>For the case of Exeter Library, please refer to this short film: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://vimeo.com/5407991">Kahn’s Exeter Short Film</a>.</p>

<br/>

<p>100 years is too long, and I don’t believe that in 500 years, mankind will only launch two nuclear strikes on Japan. Hatred and desire will always bring destruction, either to destroy human beings or the land on which they depend. and then? Rebuild it.</p>
